# CodeFX
A java based application to plot input-size time graph between two algorithms, and eventually figuring out which algorithm is asymptotically better.
To run the application please add jfree chart to your application from:
https://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/download.html
also make a connection with jdbc to your database.
run the comp_algo file after adding all the files in your project.
Here first algorithm is of MERGE SORT IN JAVA:
click on the algo1 button which will compile the java code and run the class on run time with different input size and store the running time in the database:

Second algorithm is of BUBBLE SORT:
similarly press the algo2 button and it wil perfomr similar operation for second algorithm.

After that press graph it option and you will see a clean dynamically built GRAPH and would easily be able to compute which algorithm is asymptotically faster:
